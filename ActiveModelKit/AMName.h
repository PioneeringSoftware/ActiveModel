/*!
 * @par String Subclassing
 * In Rails, @c ActiveModel::Name is a @c String subclass but not so
 * here. Instead, use the @ref value accessor for the underlying name
 * string. Objective-C utilises class clustering for @c NSString objects. Hence
 * what appears to be an @c NSString might well be some other class posing as an
 * @c NSString; this includes non-Objective-C objects such as @c
 * CFStringRef. Therefore, in Objective-C, if you want the underlying name
 * string, send <code>-[name value]</code>.

 * @details The argument identifies an Objective-C class. By convention in
 * Objective-C, the initial sequence of capital letters identify the class' name
 * space, e.g. @c NS in @c NSObject puts the class within the NextStep name
 * space. The active model name strips off these initial name-spacing
 * capitals. Hence @c NSObject yields the name @c Object.
