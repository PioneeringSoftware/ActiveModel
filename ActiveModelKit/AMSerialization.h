/*!
 * @brief Serialises an object's attributes.
 * @param objectWithAttributes Object answering an NSDictionary of attribute
 * name-values when sent -[NSObject attributes] message.
 * @param options Dictionary of options where:
 * - @ref kAMOnlyOptionKey specifies an array of attribute name strings. The
 *   “only” option defines an array of attribute names, strings, which should @e
 *   only appear in the serializable hash.
 * - @ref kAMExceptOptionKey specifies an array of attribute name strings.
 * - @ref kAMMethodsOptionKey specifies an array of selector strings.
 * @details Requires that a given object implements the -attributes method which
 * answers a dictionary of attribute name-value pairs.
 * @par Only Takes Precedence
 * Note that “only” takes precedence over “except.” You cannot have only some
 * attributes and except other attributes. If your options include both types of
 * inclusion or exclusion, the former modifies the attributes serialised, and
 * the serialisation operation ignores the latter.
